# Summer Coastal Fog in Washington through GOES-17 satellite data and field photos

This repository contains the code for the research project *Fog Frequency along Washington Coast from GOES-17 Satellite Imagery, Field Photos, and Field Sensors* by Autumn Nguyá»…n, Jessica Lundquist, Steven Pestana, and Eli Schwat (2023).


We loaded, stacked, and chunked all the raster files, and saved them in a zarr format for easy access to time series in [goes/goes_create_zarr.ipynb](goes/goes_create_zarr.ipynb).
