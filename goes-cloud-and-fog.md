### Purpose of this document

This is a work in progress...

There are several different GOES-R ABI products and "RGB" band combinations to choose from for identifying or analyzing low clouds and fog, and distinguishing low clouds and fog from higher clouds. The purpose of this document is to keep track of these different options, how they're created, what they're being used for, where to find documentation about them, and how to access/download them if possible. Here we'll just focus on binary cloud masks, and indicators of cloud height (including proxies such as cloud top pressure, temperature, or phase: i.e. water or ice). For our applications, we're less interested in the properties of clouds on their own, but instead interested in the occurrence of low clouds and fog and how they modulate surface/air temperatures (therefore we might skip over details about cloud physics).
