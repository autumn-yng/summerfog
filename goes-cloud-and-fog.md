### Purpose of this document

There are several different GOES-R ABI products and "RGB" band combinations to choose from for identifying or analyzing low clouds and fog, and distinguising low clouds and fog from higher clouds. The purpose of this document is to keep track of these different options, how they're created, what they're being used for, where to find documentation about them, and how to access/download them if possible.
